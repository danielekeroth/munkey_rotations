# The Benevolent Kidnapper
### *Discipline Priest Rotation by munkey*

Welcome to **The Benevolent Kidnapper**, the only rotation that acknowledges the fundamental truth of World of Warcraft: **Your allies are trying to kill themselves, and it is your divine duty to stop them.**

This isn't just a rotation; it's a custodial sentence for your party members.

## 🌟 Signature Feature: Yoink & Cleanse™ Technology
Why ask a DPS to move out of the fire when you can just *drag* them to safety against their will? 
*   **Auto Leap of Faith**: We monitor your party's questionable positioning choices in real-time. 
*   **Floodgate & Ara-Kara Logic**: 
    *   Standing in saws? **YOINK.**
    *   Stunned in electrified water? **YOINK.**
    *   Wandered off to Narnia during the MOMMA fight? **YOINK.**
    *   Did you just get "Nailed" in fire? **YOINK.**

We call it "repositioning." They call it "disorienting." We agree to disagree.

## 🛠️ Features & Configuration

### 🛡️ Pain Suppression: The "Who Gets to Live" Lottery
Configurable priorities for your `Pain Suppression`. 
*   **Default**: Tank & Healer (read: You).
*   **Optional**: DPS. (enable this if you're feeling generous, or if one of them is actually pumping).

### 🚀 Ultimate Penitence: The "Fine, I'll Do It Myself" Button
We don't waste the big floaty cooldown on paper cuts.
*   **Smart Triggers**: Configurable to trigger only when X number of allies drop below a critical health threshold.
*   *Result*: 3 people dying? It's flying time.

### ⚡ Power Infusion: CD Aware PI
We don't just throw PI at whoever whispers you first. This rotation tracks major cooldowns (Avatar, Combustion, Wings, etc.) and aligns your PI perfectly. 
*   *Translation:* You look like a god-tier coordinator without saying a word.

### 🪶 Angelic Feather: Cardio is for Peasants
Why walk when you can sprint?
*   **Auto-Feather**: If you're moving for more than 2 seconds (configurable), we automatically drop a feather under your feet.
*   *Result*: You are now the fastest thing in the instance.

### 😱 Psychic Scream: Mandatory Social Distancing
Too many enemies in your personal bubble?
*   **Panic Button**: If 2+ enemies are within 8 yards (or you're getting stunned), we scream at them until they leave.

### 🕸️ Spider-Man Mode (Living Silk)
Specific support for the [**Loomithar's Living Silk**](https://www.wowhead.com/item=242393/loomithars-living-silk) trinket.
*   **Smart Usage**: Can be set to hold for high burst windows or automatically fire when your team is critically low.
*   *Translation:* Min-maxing your trinkets so you don't have to.

### 🩸 Mythic+ Automation
We've hard-coded specific survival logic for:
*   **Ara-Kara**: Handling Avanoxx's shenanigans, Eye of the Swarm, and Ki'katal's grasp.
*   **Floodgate**: If there is a mechanic, we have a plan to Life Grip someone out of it.

### 🖱️ Mouseover Mastery
Full suite of mouseover support because clicking frames is so 2008.
*   **Pull with MO**: For when the tank is moving too slow. (Off by default, for your own safety).
*   **MO Penance/Flash Heal/PS**: Just point and shoot.

## 📝 How to Use
1.  Load the rotation.
2.  Select your victims (party members).
3.  Let the bot handle the atonement spreading while you focus on judging your teammates'.
4.  Enjoy the silence as they realize they can't stand in the bad anymore.
